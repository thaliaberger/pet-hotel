<h1>Pet Hotel</h1>

<p>Pet Hotel is a full stack application developed as the final project of Ironhack bootcamp.</p>
<p>The website was built using the MERN Stack. </p>
<p>This was a group project developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lauraferraz5">Laura Ferraz</a>, <a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/rodrigomatosrj">Rodrigo Matos</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thaliaberger">Thal√≠a Berger</a>.</p>

<h2>The Project</h2>

<img src="./src/images/telaInicial.png" alt="Website homepage" />

<p>Our project consists on a website of a hotel for pets, with a homepage that contains information about the hotel, pages to register the client, their pets, to book the reservation, to make the payment and a page that centralizes all this information.</p>
<p>The client can register their pets, make the reservation and manage their accomodation.</p>
<p>The Hotel accepts four types of pets: dog, cat, rabbit and :t-rex: . The client informs the name, size, gender, allergies, deseases and recommendations about their pets.</p>
<p>To book a new reservation is very simple. By clicking on the "Agendar estadia" button, the client is redirected to a page where is possible choose the dates and check the available rooms. After that, a page to make the payment will appear. There are three types of room: standard, suite and luxury.</p>
<p>We chose this theme because of our desire to work with something related to pets, and the hotel was the project that we most indetified with.</p>
